To stay motivated during your 100 days of code journey, find an accountability partner, such as a friend or family member. Share your commitment and progress with them regularly. Let them check in weekly to ask what youâ€™ve learned and review your projects like Hangman or Treasure Island. This external accountability helps prevent procrastination and keeps you consistent by encouraging perseverance.
