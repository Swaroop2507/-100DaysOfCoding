Below is a revision note with a code snippet that demonstrates how to use Python type hints for variables and functions. This example mirrors the transcript discussion by showing how to declare variable types, enforce function parameter types, and specify a functionâ€™s return type. These hints help your IDE (like PyCharm) catch type mismatches before running your code.

```python
# --- Variable Type Hints ---

# Here we declare variables with type hints.
age: int         # 'age' is expected to be an integer.
name: str        # 'name' should be a string.
height: float    # 'height' should be a float.
is_human: bool   # 'is_human' should be a boolean.

# Assigning a correct type value:
age = 19         # Correct: 19 is an integer.

# If you mistakenly assign a wrong type, e.g.:
# age = "19"    # This would be flagged by your IDE as an error since "19" is a string.

# --- Function with Type Hints ---

def police_check(age: int) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if the age is 18 or above (allowed to drive),
    otherwise returns False.
    """
    # The variable 'can_drive' is annotated as a boolean.
    can_drive: bool = True if age >= 18 else False
    return can_drive

# --- Testing the Function ---

# This will print False because 12 is below 18.
print(police_check(12))  # Output: False

# This will print True because 19 is 18 or above.
print(police_check(19))  # Output: True

# If you try calling the function with a wrong type, e.g.:
# print(police_check("12"))
# your IDE will warn you since "12" is a string, not an integer.
```

### Explanation

1. **Variable Type Hints:**
   - We declare variables (`age`, `name`, `height`, `is_human`) with explicit types.
   - Although Python is dynamically typed, these annotations help catch type errors during development.

2. **Function Type Hints:**
   - The function `police_check` specifies that its parameter `age` must be an `int` and that it returns a `bool`.
   - Inside the function, `can_drive` is also type hinted as a `bool`.
   - If you inadvertently return a value of the wrong type (for example, a string instead of a boolean), your IDE will highlight the issue.

3. **Benefits:**
   - **Error Prevention:** IDEs like PyCharm can catch mismatches before the code is run.
   - **Code Readability:** Type hints serve as documentation for the expected data types.
   - **Maintenance:** They help ensure that as your codebase grows, type-related bugs are minimized.

Using these type hints helps you write safer and more maintainable code, reducing potential runtime errors.
