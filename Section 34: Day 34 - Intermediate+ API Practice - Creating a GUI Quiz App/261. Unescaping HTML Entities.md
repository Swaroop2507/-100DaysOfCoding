Below is an updated snippet showing how you can import the `html` module and use its `unescape` function to convert HTML entities from the API into human-readable text. In this example, we assume that your quiz brain class is responsible for fetching and formatting the question text. By applying `html.unescape` to the question string, any HTML entities (such as `&quot;` or `&#039;`) will be replaced with the appropriate characters.

```python
import html

class QuizBrain:
    def __init__(self, q_list):
        self.question_number = 0
        self.score = 0
        self.question_list = q_list

    def still_has_questions(self):
        return self.question_number < len(self.question_list)

    def next_question(self):
        """Retrieve the next question, unescaping HTML entities so the text is human readable."""
        current_question = self.question_list[self.question_number]
        self.question_number += 1
        # Unescape the question text so that HTML entities are converted to normal characters.
        q_text = html.unescape(current_question["question"])
        return f"Q.{self.question_number}: {q_text}"

    def check_answer(self, user_answer):
        correct_answer = self.question_list[self.question_number - 1]["correct_answer"]
        if user_answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():
            self.score += 1
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation

1. **Importing the HTML Module:**  
   The `import html` statement allows us to use the built-in HTML module.

2. **Using `html.unescape`:**  
   Within the `next_question` method, after retrieving the question text from the API (which may contain HTML entities), we pass the text through `html.unescape()`.  
   For example, if the API returns `"Stalin&#039;s death"`, it will be converted to `"Stalin's death"`.

3. **Formatted Question Output:**  
   The unescaped text is then incorporated into the question string that is returned, ensuring that the text displayed to the user is clean and human-readable.

Using this approach, every time a new question is fetched from the API, any encoded HTML entities will be correctly translated. This is an essential skill for working with external data sources, and it will make your application much more user-friendly.
