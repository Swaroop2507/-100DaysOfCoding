Explanation
get_next_question Method:

Resets the canvas background to white.
Checks if there are still questions left using self.quiz.still_has_questions().
If yes, it fetches the next question (and updates the score label) and displays the question on the canvas.
If not, it updates the canvas to inform the user that the quiz has ended and disables the True/False buttons.
give_feedback Method:

Changes the canvas background to green if the answer was correct or red if it was wrong.
Uses self.window.after(1000, self.get_next_question) to wait 1 second before moving to the next question. Notice that the function reference self.get_next_question is passed without parentheses.
Button Press Methods (true_pressed and false_pressed):

These methods call the quiz brainâ€™s check_answer method, which returns a Boolean.
Then they call give_feedback with that Boolean to display the appropriate color and transition to the next question.
