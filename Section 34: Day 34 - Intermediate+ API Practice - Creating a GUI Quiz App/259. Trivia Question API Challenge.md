Below is an example of how you can modify your **data.py** file to fetch 10 new True/False questions from the Open Trivia Database API instead of using hard-coded data. Once you've made these changes, running **main.py** will use the API data.

```python
import requests

# Set up parameters for the API call:
parameters = {
    "amount": 10,      # Number of questions
    "type": "boolean"  # True/False questions
}

# Make the API request:
response = requests.get("https://opentdb.com/api.php", params=parameters)
response.raise_for_status()  # Optional: raises an error if the request fails

# Convert the response to a dictionary:
data = response.json()

# Extract the list of question dictionaries from the "results" key:
question_data = data["results"]
```

### How It Works

1. **Parameters Dictionary:**  
   We set the `amount` to 10 and `type` to `"boolean"`, which means the API will return 10 True/False questions. (The category and difficulty are left out so they remain blank.)

2. **API Request:**  
   Using the `requests.get` method with our parameters, we fetch the data from the API endpoint.

3. **Parsing the JSON Response:**  
   The JSON data is converted into a Python dictionary with `response.json()`. We then extract the list of question dictionaries using `data["results"]`.

4. **Replacing Hard-Coded Data:**  
   The variable `question_data` now holds the list of questions from the API. This variable should be used throughout your project in place of any hard-coded question data.

After updating **data.py** with this snippet, you can comment out or remove the previous hard-coded question data. Now, when you run **main.py**, it will fetch fresh questions from the API each time.

Happy coding!
