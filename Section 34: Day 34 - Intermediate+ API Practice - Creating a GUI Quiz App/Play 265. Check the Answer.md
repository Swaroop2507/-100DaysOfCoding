Below is an example snippet that shows how to add functionality to the True and False buttons. In this snippet, two new methods—`true_pressed` and `false_pressed`—are created within the UI class. Each of these methods calls the quiz brain's `check_answer` method (passing in `"True"` or `"False"` accordingly), so that when the user clicks on one of the buttons, the answer is checked and a message is printed in the console (for now).

> **Note:** Later on you can replace the console print with visual feedback for the user.

```python
from tkinter import *
from quiz_brain import QuizBrain  # Ensure this is the correct import for your QuizBrain class
THEME_COLOR = "#375362"

class QuizInterface:
    def __init__(self, quiz: QuizBrain):
        self.quiz = quiz
        
        self.window = Tk()
        self.window.title("Quizzler")
        self.window.config(padx=20, pady=20, bg=THEME_COLOR)
        
        # Score Label
        self.score_label = Label(text="Score: 0", fg="white", bg=THEME_COLOR, font=("Arial", 12))
        self.score_label.grid(row=0, column=1)
        
        # Canvas for Question Text
        self.canvas = Canvas(width=300, height=250, bg="white")
        self.question_text = self.canvas.create_text(
            150, 125,
            width=280,
            text="Some Question Text",
            fill=THEME_COLOR,
            font=("Arial", 20, "italic")
        )
        self.canvas.grid(row=1, column=0, columnspan=2, pady=50)
        
        # Buttons with images and commands set up:
        true_image = PhotoImage(file="images/true.png")
        self.true_button = Button(image=true_image, highlightthickness=0, command=self.true_pressed)
        self.true_button.grid(row=2, column=0)
        
        false_image = PhotoImage(file="images/false.png")
        self.false_button = Button(image=false_image, highlightthickness=0, command=self.false_pressed)
        self.false_button.grid(row=2, column=1)
        
        # Load the first question from the quiz brain
        self.get_next_question()
        
        self.window.mainloop()
    
    def get_next_question(self):
        """Fetch the next question text from the quiz brain and display it on the canvas."""
        q_text = self.quiz.next_question()
        self.canvas.itemconfig(self.question_text, text=q_text)
        # Update the score label (if necessary)
        self.score_label.config(text=f"Score: {self.quiz.score}")
    
    def true_pressed(self):
        """Called when the user presses the 'True' button."""
        # Check the answer via the quiz brain and pass "True" as the answer.
        is_right = self.quiz.check_answer("True")
        # For now, print the result to the console.
        print(f"User selected True. Correct? {is_right}")
    
    def false_pressed(self):
        """Called when the user presses the 'False' button."""
        # Check the answer via the quiz brain and pass "False" as the answer.
        is_right = self.quiz.check_answer("False")
        # For now, print the result to the console.
        print(f"User selected False. Correct? {is_right}")

# Example usage: (make sure to adjust imports as needed)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from data import question_data  # Replace with your actual data file/module
    quiz = QuizBrain(question_data)
    QuizInterface(quiz)
```

### Explanation

1. **Button Commands:**
   - In the `__init__` method, the `command` parameter of each button is set to `self.true_pressed` or `self.false_pressed` (without parentheses). This ensures that the method is called only when the button is clicked.

2. **`true_pressed` and `false_pressed` Methods:**
   - These methods call `self.quiz.check_answer("True")` or `self.quiz.check_answer("False")` respectively.
   - The returned result (a boolean indicating if the answer was correct) is printed to the console. In the future, you might change this to provide visual feedback on the UI.

3. **Integration with Quiz Brain:**
   - The quiz brain (an instance of `QuizBrain`) is passed into the `QuizInterface` class and stored as `self.quiz`, allowing the UI methods to interact with the quiz logic.

By following this approach, clicking either button will now correctly trigger a check of the answer against the API-provided data via the quiz brain. Enjoy extending this functionality with more user feedback in later lessons!
