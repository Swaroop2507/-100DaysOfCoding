Below is an example **data.py** file that follows the instructions from the transcript. This code uses the `requests` module to fetch data from the Open Trivia Database API, prints the full data (so you can inspect it), and then extracts the list of questions from the `"results"` key, saving it as `question_data`.

```python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint (everything before the question mark)
url = "https://opentdb.com/api.php"

# Define the parameters as a dictionary
parameters = {
    "amount": 10,       # Number of questions to fetch
    "type": "boolean"   # We want True/False questions
}

# Make a GET request to the API with the specified parameters
response = requests.get(url, params=parameters)
response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for any HTTP errors

# Get the data as a dictionary using the JSON method
data = response.json()

# (Optional) Print the entire data to see its structure
print(data)

# Extract the list of questions from the 'results' key and store it in question_data
question_data = data["results"]
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Requests:**  
   We begin by importing the `requests` module.

2. **API Endpoint & Parameters:**  
   - The base URL is `https://opentdb.com/api.php`.
   - The parameters dictionary specifies that we want 10 questions (`"amount": 10`) and that these questions should be of type boolean (`"type": "boolean"`).

3. **Fetching Data:**  
   - We make a GET request to the API, passing in the parameters.
   - `response.raise_for_status()` ensures that any HTTP errors are raised immediately.
   - The `response.json()` method converts the JSON response into a Python dictionary.

4. **Extracting the Results:**  
   - The API returns a dictionary with a `"results"` key, which holds the list of question dictionaries.
   - We extract this list and assign it to the variable `question_data`.

When you run **data.py**, it will print the entire data structure from the API and store the list of questions in `question_data`. This data is then available to be used by the rest of your quiz application.
