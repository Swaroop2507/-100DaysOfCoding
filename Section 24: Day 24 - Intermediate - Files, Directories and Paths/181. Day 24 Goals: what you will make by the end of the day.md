### **Code Base: Snake Game with High Score**
Hereâ€™s an updated code base based on the data provided, including saving the high score to a file so it persists between game sessions:

#### **main.py**
```python
from turtle import Screen
from snake import Snake
from food import Food
from scoreboard import Scoreboard
import time

# Screen setup
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.bgcolor("black")
screen.title("Snake Game")
screen.tracer(0)

# Create game components
snake = Snake()
food = Food()
scoreboard = Scoreboard()

# Control the snake
screen.listen()
screen.onkey(snake.up, "Up")
screen.onkey(snake.down, "Down")
screen.onkey(snake.left, "Left")
screen.onkey(snake.right, "Right")

# Game logic
game_is_on = True
while game_is_on:
    screen.update()
    time.sleep(0.1)
    snake.move()

    # Detect collision with food
    if snake.head.distance(food) < 15:
        food.refresh()
        snake.extend()
        scoreboard.increase_score()

    # Detect collision with wall
    if (
        snake.head.xcor() > 290
        or snake.head.xcor() < -290
        or snake.head.ycor() > 290
        or snake.head.ycor() < -290
    ):
        scoreboard.reset()
        snake.reset()

    # Detect collision with tail
    for segment in snake.segments[1:]:
        if snake.head.distance(segment) < 10:
            scoreboard.reset()
            snake.reset()

screen.exitonclick()
```

#### **snake.py**
```python
from turtle import Turtle

STARTING_POSITIONS = [(0, 0), (-20, 0), (-40, 0)]
MOVE_DISTANCE = 20
UP = 90
DOWN = 270
LEFT = 180
RIGHT = 0

class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.segments = []
        self.create_snake()
        self.head = self.segments[0]

    def create_snake(self):
        for position in STARTING_POSITIONS:

        segment.color("white")
        segment.penup()
        segment.goto(position)
        self.segments.append(segment)

    def reset(self):
        for segment in self.segments:
            segment.goto(1000, 1000)
        self.segments.clear()
        self.create_snake()
        self.head = self.segments[0]

    def extend(self):
        self.add_segment(self.segments[-1].position())

    def move(self):
        for seg_num in range(len(self.segments) - 1, 0, -1):
            new_x = self.segments[seg_num - 1].xcor()
            new_y = self.segments[seg_num - 1].ycor()
            self.segments[seg_num].goto(new_x, new_y)
        self.head.forward(MOVE_DISTANCE)

    def up(self):

            self.head.setheading(UP)

    def down(self):
        if self.head.heading() != UP:
            self.head.setheading(DOWN)

    def left(self):
        if self.head.heading() != RIGHT:

    def right(self):
        if self.head.heading() != LEFT:
            self.head.setheading(RIGHT)
```

#### **food.py**
```python
from turtle import Turtle
import random

class Food(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("circle")
        self.color("blue")
        self.penup()
        self.speed("fastest")
        self.refresh()

    def refresh(self):
        random_x = random.randint(-280, 280)
        random_y = random.randint(-280, 280)
        self.goto(random_x, random_y)
```

#### **scoreboard.py**
```python
from turtle import Turtle

ALIGNMENT = "center"
FONT = ("Courier", 24, "normal")

class Scoreboard(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.score = 0
        try:
            with open("data.txt") as file:
                self.high_score = int(file.read())
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self.high_score = 0
        self.color("white")
        self.penup()
        self.hideturtle()
        self.goto(0, 270)
        self.update_scoreboard()

    def update_scoreboard(self):
        self.clear()
        self.write(f"Score: {self.score} High Score: {self.high_score}", align=ALIGNMENT, font=FONT)

    def reset(self):
        if self.score > self.high_score:
            self.high_score = self.score
            with open("data.txt", mode="w") as file:
                file.write(str(self.high_score))
        self.score = 0
        self.update_scoreboard()

    def increase_score(self):
        self.score += 1
        self.update_scoreboard()
```

### **Explanation**
1. **High Score Persistence**: The `data.txt` file is used to store the high score. Each time the game starts, the file is read, and the high score is retrieved.
2. **Snake Reset**: When the snake dies (collision with wall or tail), it resets to the starting position.
3. **Food Refresh**: The food changes position every time it is eaten, encouraging continuous gameplay.
4. **Score Reset and Update**: If the player dies, the score resets but the high score remains unless the new score exceeds it.
5. **Clean Code Design**: Classes (`Snake`, `Food`, and `Scoreboard`) encapsulate functionality for easier updates and maintenance.

### **5 Questions You Learned**
1. **Why does the high score reset every time I restart the game?**  
   **Answer**: The high score resets because the variable is stored in memory, which is cleared when the program ends. Using a file (`data.txt`) solves this issue.

2. **Why do we need a reset method in the Snake class?**  
   **Answer**: To handle restarting the game properly by clearing existing segments and reinitializing the snake without leaving artifacts on the screen.

3. **Why is the `update_scoreboard` method important?**  
   **Answer**: It ensures the current score and high score are updated and displayed on the screen in real-time.

4. **Why is the `food.refresh()` method called after the snake eats food?**  
   **Answer**: To generate a new food location and continue gameplay dynamically.

5. **Why do we loop through segments in `snake.reset()` to move them off-screen?**  
   **Answer**: Without doing so, the segments of the old snake would linger on the screen even though they are logically removed from the game.
