### **Code Base and Explanation**  

#### Code for Handling Absolute and Relative File Paths:  

```python
# Example of using an absolute file path
absolute_path = "C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/my_file.txt"  # Replace with your actual file path
with open(absolute_path, mode='r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Absolute Path Content:", content)

# Example of using a relative file path
relative_path = "../../Desktop/my_file.txt"  # Adjust relative to your working directory
with open(relative_path, mode='r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Relative Path Content:", content)
```

#### Explanation:  
1. **Absolute File Path**: This method gives the exact location of the file, starting from the root directory. For example, `C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/my_file.txt` leads Python directly to the file location.  
2. **Relative File Path**: This path is relative to your current working directory. For instance, `../../Desktop/my_file.txt` moves two folders up (`..`) and then navigates into the `Desktop` folder to locate the file.  
3. The `with` statement ensures that the file is automatically closed after its block of code is executed, avoiding manual file closure.

### **5 "Why" Questions and Answers Based on the Content**  

#### **1. Why do we use absolute file paths?**  
**Q**: Why is an absolute file path important?  
**A**: Absolute paths provide the exact location of a file starting from the root directory. They ensure that the program accesses the correct file, regardless of the working directory.  

#### **2. Why do we use relative file paths?**  
**Q**: Why might you prefer relative file paths over absolute file paths?  
**A**: Relative file paths make your code more portable. If your file structure moves or changes between systems, relative paths adapt as long as the relative positions remain intact.  

#### **3. Why use `../` in relative paths?**  
**Q**: Why do we use `../` when specifying a relative path?  
**A**: The `../` allows you to move up one folder in the directory structure. For example, `../../` moves up two levels before looking for a file.  

#### **4. Why does Python use `/` instead of `\` for paths?**  
**Q**: Why can we use `/` for paths in Python, even on Windows?  
**A**: Python abstracts the underlying system, so it allows `/` universally for paths, making the code more consistent and avoiding issues caused by escape characters (`\`).  

#### **5. Why does a `FileNotFoundError` occur?**  
**Q**: Why does Python raise a `FileNotFoundError`?  
**A**: This error occurs when the specified path (absolute or relative) is incorrect or the file does not exist at the given location. Always verify the path using properties or `Reveal in Explorer/Finder`.
