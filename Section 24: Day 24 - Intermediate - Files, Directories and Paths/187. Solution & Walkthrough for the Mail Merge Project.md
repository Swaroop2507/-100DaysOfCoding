### Mail Merge Project Solution

I hope you've given this project a good attempt! Now, let’s go through the solution together.

#### Reviewing Key Methods

Here are the three Python methods that are crucial for this project:

1. **`readlines()`**
   - This method returns all the lines in a file as a list, where each line becomes an item in the list.
   - Example: If the file contains several lines, `readlines()` will produce a list with each line as a separate string.

2. **`replace()`**
   - The `replace()` method replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase.
   - Example:
     - Starting text: `"I like bananas"`
     - Using `txt.replace("bananas", "apples")` will result in `"I like apples"`.

3. **`strip()`**
   - This method removes whitespace (including newlines) from the beginning and end of a string.
   - Example:
     - Input: `"   hello   \n"`
     - Using `txt.strip()` will produce `"hello"`, keeping any spaces within the text itself intact.

#### Step-by-Step Solution

##### 1. Reading the List of Names
The first step is to get all the names from the `invited_names.txt` file and turn them into a list. Instead of manually creating a list, Python can do this for us.

```python
with open("./Input/Names/invited_names.txt") as names_file:
    names = names_file.readlines()
```
- **Explanation**:  
  - The `with open()` statement opens the file safely.
  - The `readlines()` method reads all the lines and converts them into a list. Each name in the file becomes an item in the list.

##### 2. Preparing the Starting Letter
Next, we need to load the contents of the starting letter (`starting_letter.docx`) into memory.

```python
PLACEHOLDER = "[name]"

with open("./Input/Letters/starting_letter.docx") as letter_file:
    letter_contents = letter_file.read()
```
- **Explanation**:  
  - The placeholder `[name]` will be replaced with actual names later.
  - The `read()` method loads the entire content of the letter into a variable as a string.

##### 3. Replacing the Placeholder
We loop through each name in the list, replace the placeholder `[name]` with the actual name, and strip any extra whitespace.

```python
for name in names:
    stripped_name = name.strip()
    new_letter = letter_contents.replace(PLACEHOLDER, stripped_name)
```
- **Explanation**:  
  - The `strip()` method removes any newlines or extra spaces from the names.
  - The `replace()` method substitutes the placeholder `[name]` with the stripped name.

##### 4. Writing the Letters
We write each personalized letter into a new file inside the `ReadyToSend` folder. Each file will be named `letter_for_<name>.docx`.

```python
    with open(f"./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_{stripped_name}.docx", mode="w") as completed_letter:
        completed_letter.write(new_letter)
```
- **Explanation**:  
  - Using an f-string, we dynamically generate the filename for each letter.
  - The file is opened in write mode (`"w"`), which creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.
  - The `write()` method writes the personalized letter content into the new file.

#### Final Code
Here is the complete solution:

```python
PLACEHOLDER = "[name]"

# Step 1: Read names from the file
with open("./Input/Names/invited_names.txt") as names_file:
    names = names_file.readlines()

# Step 2: Read the starting letter
with open("./Input/Letters/starting_letter.docx") as letter_file:
    letter_contents = letter_file.read()

# Step 3: Personalize and write each letter
for name in names:
    stripped_name = name.strip()
    new_letter = letter_contents.replace(PLACEHOLDER, stripped_name)
    with open(f"./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_{stripped_name}.docx", mode="w") as completed_letter:
        completed_letter.write(new_letter)
```

#### Output
When you run this script:
1. Personalized letters are generated for each name in `invited_names.txt`.
2. The letters are saved in the `Output/ReadyToSend` folder.
3. Each letter replaces `[name]` with the actual name and is ready for printing.

#### Wrapping Up
Did you manage to complete the project? If not, take some time to review:
- The use of `readlines()`, `replace()`, and `strip()` methods.
- How file paths and file handling work in Python.

If you’re stuck, revisit the solution, and don’t hesitate to consult Python documentation or Stack Overflow. For reference, the final project code is available in the course resources. Good luck!
