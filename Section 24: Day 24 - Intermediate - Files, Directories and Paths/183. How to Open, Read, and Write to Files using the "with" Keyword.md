### Codebase and Explanation:

Here is a Python script that demonstrates all the concepts covered in your data:

```python
# Open a file and read its contents
with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print("File Contents (Read Mode):")
    print(contents)

# Write to a file (overwrites existing content)
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is the new content.\n")

# Append to a file (adds to the existing content)
with open("my_file.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("This is appended content.\n")

# Read the file again to confirm changes
with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
    updated_contents = file.read()
    print("\nFile Contents (After Write and Append):")
    print(updated_contents)

# Create a new file and write to it
with open("new_file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This file was created because it didn't exist.\n")

# Confirm the new file was created
with open("new_file.txt", "r") as file:
    new_file_contents = file.read()
    print("\nNew File Contents:")
    print(new_file_contents)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Opening and Reading Files**:
   - The `open()` function with mode `'r'` opens a file in read-only mode. 
   - Use `.read()` to fetch all contents as a string.

2. **Writing to Files**:
   - The `open()` function with mode `'w'` opens a file in write mode. If the file exists, its content is overwritten. If it doesn't exist, a new file is created.

3. **Appending to Files**:
   - Mode `'a'` allows adding new content to the end of an existing file without erasing the previous data.

4. **Using the `with` Statement**:
   - The `with` statement ensures that the file is automatically closed after the block of code is executed, avoiding resource leaks.

5. **Creating Files**:
   - When opening a file in `'w'` mode and it doesn't exist, Python automatically creates the file.

### 5 "Whys" With Questions and Answers:

1. **Why use the `with` statement for file handling?**  
   - **Q**: Why is `with` preferred over manually calling `file.close()`?  
   - **A**: `with` automatically handles file closing, even if an error occurs during file operations, ensuring proper resource management.

2. **Why does writing to a file delete its contents?**  
   - **Q**: Why is the file content erased when using `'w'` mode?  
   - **A**: The `'w'` mode is specifically designed to overwrite existing data. Use `'a'` mode to preserve and add to existing content.

3. **Why is the `\n` character used in strings?**  
   - **Q**: Why is `\n` added to the string while appending to a file?  
   - **A**: The `\n` ensures a new line is added, so appended content starts on a fresh line rather than being concatenated with the previous line.

4. **Why does Python create files in `'w'` mode?**  
   - **Q**: Why does Python create a file that doesn't exist when opened in `'w'` mode?  
   - **A**: This behavior simplifies file handling, enabling programmers to create and write to new files without additional checks.

5. **Why should we avoid leaving files open?**  
   - **Q**: Why is it important to close files after operations?  
   - **A**: Open files consume system resources. Leaving files open may cause resource exhaustion and unexpected behavior in the program.
