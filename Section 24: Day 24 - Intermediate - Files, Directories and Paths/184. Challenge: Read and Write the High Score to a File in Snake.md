### Code Implementation and Explanation:

Here's the Python code that fulfills the challenge. It uses a `data.txt` file to read and write the high score for the snake game.

#### Code:

```python
class SnakeGame:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the score and load the high score from the file
        self.score = 0
        try:
            with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
                self.high_score = int(file.read())
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError):
            # If file is not found or data is invalid, set high score to 0
            self.high_score = 0

    def reset_game(self):
        # Compare current score with high score and update if needed
        if self.score > self.high_score:
            self.high_score = self.score
            with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
                file.write(str(self.high_score))
        self.score = 0  # Reset the score for the new game

    def update_score(self, points):
        # Increment the score
        self.score += points
        print(f"Current Score: {self.score}, High Score: {self.high_score}")


# Example usage:
game = SnakeGame()

# Simulate scoring
game.update_score(5)
game.update_score(3)

# Reset the game and update the high score if needed
game.reset_game()

# Restart the game to verify high score persistence
new_game = SnakeGame()
print(f"High Score on Restart: {new_game.high_score}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading High Score**:
   - When the `SnakeGame` class initializes, it reads the high score from `data.txt`.
   - If the file doesn't exist or contains invalid data, the high score defaults to `0`.

2. **Updating the High Score**:
   - When the game resets (using `reset_game`), the program checks if the current score is greater than the high score.
   - If so, it updates the high score and writes the new value to `data.txt`.

3. **Writing to the File**:
   - The `open()` function is used with the `"w"` mode to overwrite the `data.txt` file with the new high score.
   - Using an `f-string` ensures that the integer is correctly converted to a string before writing.

4. **Persistent High Score**:
   - Even after stopping and restarting the program, the high score remains saved in `data.txt`.

### 5 Key "Why" Questions and Answers:

1. **Why use a file for storing the high score?**
   - To ensure the high score persists across game sessions. Without it, restarting the game resets the high score to `0`.

2. **Why use the `with` keyword for file handling?**
   - It ensures that the file is properly closed after the operations are completed, avoiding potential file lock or resource issues.

3. **Why check for `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`?**
   - To handle cases where `data.txt` might be missing or contain non-numeric data, ensuring the program doesn't crash.

4. **Why convert the read data to an integer?**
   - File data is read as strings, but scores are numeric. Conversion ensures proper comparison and mathematical operations.

5. **Why use `"w"` mode when writing the high score?**
   - The `"w"` mode overwrites the file with the new high score, ensuring only the latest value is stored.
