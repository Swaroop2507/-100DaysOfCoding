## Mail Merge Project: Test Your Skills

It's time to put what you've learned to the test! In this project, we'll be creating a simple **mail merge** automation. Mail merging involves taking a list of names and inserting them into a pre-written letter template.

### Objective
You will write Python code to:
1. Read a list of names from `invited_names.txt`.
2. Replace a placeholder (e.g., `[name]`) in the `starting_letter.txt` with each name from the list.
3. Save the resulting personalized letters in the `ReadyToSend` folder.

### Expected Output
For each name in `invited_names.txt`, generate a letter named as:
```
letter_for_<name>.txt
```
Each file should:
- Be saved in the `ReadyToSend` folder.
- Contain the personalized content with the placeholder replaced by the name.

### File and Folder Structure
Hereâ€™s the folder layout:
- `input/`
  - `letters/`
    - `starting_letter.txt`
  - `invited_names.txt`
- `output/`
  - `ReadyToSend/`

### Instructions
1. **Download the Starting Project Code**
   - Go to the course resources and download the ZIP file for this project.
   - Extract the files and open the project in PyCharm.

2. **Configure the Python Interpreter**
   - Upon opening the project, PyCharm may prompt you to configure the interpreter.
   - Select the latest Python version installed on your computer. (E.g., Python 3.8, 3.9, or later.)

3. **Review the Starting Files**
   - Open `main.py` for instructions and hints.
   - The `starting_letter.txt` contains the letter template, while `invited_names.txt` contains the list of names.

4. **Challenge Implementation**
   - Use the content of `starting_letter.txt` as a template.
   - Replace the placeholder `[name]` in the template with each name from `invited_names.txt`.
   - Save the personalized letters in the `ReadyToSend/` folder, naming them as `letter_for_<name>.txt`.

5. **Hints**
   - Use the documentation links provided in the comments of `main.py` to understand specific Python methods that will help you:
     - Reading and writing files.
     - Navigating file paths.
     - String manipulation.

6. **Rules**
   - Do not manually move files or folders; use Python to handle file paths and navigation.
   - Ensure proper relative or absolute file paths are used based on the context of your code.

### Helpful Notes
- **Absolute vs Relative Paths:**
  - Absolute paths start from the root of your computer (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\...` on Windows or `/Users/YourName/Desktop/...` on Mac).
  - Relative paths are based on the current working directory.

- **Folder Navigation:**
  - `..` moves up one folder in the directory tree.
  - `./` refers to the current working directory.

### Final Thoughts
You may encounter challenges while working through this project, such as navigating through nested folders and using unfamiliar methods. Use your skills to:
- Research solutions on Google or Stack Overflow.
- Understand Python documentation for the methods linked in `main.py`.

Remember, this is an opportunity to practice solving real-world coding problems, just as professional developers do. Good luck, and happy coding!
