### **Hangman Game – Step 3: Repeated Guessing and Display Updates**

#### **Key Concepts (The 20% You Need)**
1. **While Loop for Repeated Guessing**:  
   A while loop runs repeatedly until a condition is no longer met.  
   Syntax:  
   ```python
   while condition:
       # Code block that keeps running until condition becomes False
   ```

2. **Game Over Condition**:  
   We use a variable `game_over` initialized to `False` to control when the game ends.  
   The loop exits when there are no more blanks (`'_'`) in the `display` list.

3. **Updating Previous Guesses in Display**:  
   Instead of replacing correct guesses, we store them using a **list** and append letters that were guessed correctly to keep them persistent across guesses.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

#### **Step 1: Create a While Loop for Repeated Guesses**
1. Set `game_over = False` before the loop begins.
2. Use `while not game_over:` to keep prompting the user until the condition changes.
3. Inside the loop:
   - Get the user’s guess.
   - Check if the guessed letter is in the word.
   - Update the `display` list accordingly.

**Code Example**:
```python
game_over = False
while not game_over:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()  # Get user input
    # Logic for updating display and checking win condition goes here
```

#### **Step 2: Use a Condition to Exit the Loop**
Check if all underscores (`'_'`) are filled. If no underscores remain, set `game_over = True` and print a win message.

**Code Snippet**:
```python
if "_" not in display:
    game_over = True
    print("You win!")
```

#### **Step 3: Keep Previous Guesses in Display**
1. Create a list `correct_letters` outside the loop to track correctly guessed letters.
2. Use a loop to check each letter of the word:
   - If the letter matches the guess, update `display` and add to `correct_letters`.
   - If the letter is in `correct_letters`, keep it in the `display`.
   - Otherwise, add an underscore.

**Code for Updating Display**:
```python
correct_letters = []  # Tracks correctly guessed letters
while not game_over:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
    for position in range(len(chosen_word)):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter
            correct_letters.append(letter)  # Add correct guess
        elif letter in correct_letters:
            display[position] = letter
        else:
            display[position] = "_"
    print(f"Current word: {' '.join(display)}")
    if "_" not in display:
        game_over = True
        print("You win!")
```

### **Actionable Tips**
1. **Indentation Matters**:  
   Ensure all code within the `while` loop is indented so it runs repeatedly.

2. **Avoid Infinite Loops**:  
   Always include a condition that eventually breaks the loop (like `if "_" not in display:`) to prevent the program from running forever.

3. **Use Lists for Dynamic Data**:  
   - Store previous correct guesses in a list to keep the display persistent.
   - Append new correct guesses to this list.

### **Common Pitfalls and Fixes**
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| The game doesn't end. | No condition to break out of the loop. | Use `if "_" not in display:` to set `game_over = True`. |
| Previous guesses disappear after each loop. | `display` resets on each iteration. | Keep `correct_letters` outside the loop. |
| Infinite loop occurs. | Condition never changes. | Ensure `game_over` gets set to `True` when conditions are met. |

### **Summary**
By focusing on loops, conditions, and lists, this step adds core game functionality. Mastering while loops and list operations will give you a solid foundation for future Python projects.
