Here’s a concise, **hands-on step-by-step guide** for **Step 2** of creating the Hangman game, applying the **Pareto Principle** by focusing on the 20% of core concepts and code patterns that will give you 80% of the functionality.

---

### **Core Concepts (20% that leads to 80% of results):**
1. **Looping through a word with `for` loops** to create placeholders.
2. **Using `if` statements** to check and update guessed letters.
3. **String manipulation** with `+=` to build a dynamic output string (`display`).

---

### **Step 2: Displaying Placeholders and Updating Guessed Letters**

#### 1. **Creating a Placeholder for the Word**
**Goal:** Show an underscore for each letter in `chosen_word`.

**Key Code:**
```python
# Example chosen_word
chosen_word = "apple"  # This will be dynamic in your game

# TODO 1: Create an empty string for the placeholder
placeholder = ""  # Initialize empty string

# Calculate word length
word_length = len(chosen_word)

# Loop to create underscores matching the length of chosen_word
for _ in range(word_length):  # Use `_` if the variable isn't needed
    placeholder += "_"

# Check the placeholder output
print(placeholder)  # Expected: "_____"
```

**Key Idea:**  
- `range(len(chosen_word))` runs the loop for each letter in the word.
- `"_"` represents an unguessed letter.

---

#### 2. **Updating the Display with Guessed Letters**
**Goal:** Place guessed letters in the correct positions and show underscores for the rest.

**Key Code:**
```python
# Example user input
guess = "p"

# Initialize an empty display string
display = ""

# Loop through each letter in chosen_word
for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        display += letter  # Add the correctly guessed letter
    else:
        display += "_"  # Add an underscore for unguessed letters

# Check the display output
print(display)  # Expected: "_pp__" if chosen_word is "apple" and guess is "p"
```

**Key Idea:**  
- Use `if letter == guess` to check for matches.
- `display += letter` adds the guessed letter to the output string.
- `display += "_"` adds blanks for unguessed letters.

---

### **Practical Example of Full Code for Step 2**
```python
# Example chosen word
chosen_word = "aardvark"  # For testing purposes
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()  # User input

# Create a placeholder for word length
placeholder = ""
for _ in range(len(chosen_word)):
    placeholder += "_"
print(f"Word placeholder: {placeholder}")  # Initial blanks for user

# Initialize the display to show guessed letters
display = ""
for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        display += letter
    else:
        display += "_"
        
# Display the result after guessing
print(f"Updated display: {display}")
```

---

### **Actionable Tips**
1. **Use the `len()` function** to get the length of a word, avoiding hardcoding numbers.  
   Example: `len("apple")` returns `5`.
2. **Use `_` as a loop variable** when you don’t need its value to keep your code clean.  
   Example: `for _ in range(len(chosen_word)):`
3. **Use `+=` to build strings dynamically** instead of creating new strings repeatedly.  
   Example: `display += letter` or `display += "_"`.

---

### **Challenges and Exercises**
1. Modify the example to handle multiple guesses and update `display` for each guess.
2. Add print statements to debug and watch the loop iterate over each letter.
