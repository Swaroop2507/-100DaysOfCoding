Here’s a step-by-step guide based on the provided lesson, applying the **Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)** to focus on the most impactful concepts that yield the greatest results. This will simplify your learning and provide actionable, hands-on notes.

### **Pareto-Focused Learning for Hangman Step 4**

#### **Key Objectives (20% of the Effort):**
1. **Track Lives:** Create a `lives` variable that decrements with incorrect guesses.
2. **Use Conditional Logic:** Check if a guessed letter is not in the word and reduce lives.
3. **Display ASCII Art Progressively:** Use the `stages` list to show hangman progress corresponding to the number of lives.

These three concepts drive 80% of the gameplay functionality for this step.

### **Step-by-Step Hands-On Guide**

#### 1. **Set Up a `lives` Variable**
**Action:**  
Create a variable `lives` initialized to 6 (the maximum number of lives).  

**Code Example:**
```python
lives = 6
```

---

#### 2. **Reduce Lives for Incorrect Guesses**
**Concept:**  
When the player guesses a letter, check if it’s in the chosen word. If not, reduce `lives` by 1.

**Action:**  
Use an `if` statement with the `not in` keyword to determine if a guessed letter is incorrect.

**Code Example:**
```python
if guess not in chosen_word:
    lives -= 1  # Reduce lives by 1
    if lives == 0:
        game_over = True
        print("You lose.")
```

**Explanation:**  
- `if guess not in chosen_word:` checks if the guess is not part of the word.  
- `lives -= 1` subtracts one life.  
- If `lives` equals 0, set `game_over` to `True` and print `"You lose."`

#### 3. **Display ASCII Art Using the `stages` List**
**Concept:**  
The `stages` list contains hangman ASCII art. Each index represents a specific life count.  

**Action:**  
Print the ASCII art corresponding to the current number of lives.

**Code Example:**
```python
print(stages[lives])
```

**Placement:**  
This should be placed inside the game loop, so it updates every time the player guesses.

---

### **Complete Structure (Putting It Together)**
```python
# Assume stages and chosen_word are already defined
lives = 6
game_over = False

while not game_over:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
    
    if guess not in chosen_word:
        lives -= 1
        print(stages[lives])  # Display corresponding hangman art
        if lives == 0:
            game_over = True
            print("You lose.")
```

---

### **Practical Tips**
1. **Visualize the ASCII Art Progression:**  
   Experiment by printing different `stages` indexes (e.g., `stages[0]`, `stages[3]`) to see how they match the lives remaining.
   
2. **Think Step-by-Step for Debugging:**  
   Keep the `if` statement for incorrect guesses separate from other game logic. This separation makes it easier to debug.

3. **Revisit Conditional Logic:**  
   Understand how `if`, `elif`, and `else` help control game flow. Use comments in your code to clarify the purpose of each condition.

---

### **Actionable Exercises**
1. **Modify the Art:**  
   Add a custom message to each hangman stage to make the game more interactive.
   
2. **Edge Case Practice:**  
   Test with words containing repeating letters (e.g., "balloon") to ensure correct logic when handling multiple guesses.
