### **Core 20% of Key Concepts**
1. **Understand the Game Structure**
   - **Objective**: Guess the letters of a hidden word before running out of attempts.
   - **Game Elements**:  
     - A word to guess (chosen randomly).  
     - A display of blanks representing unguessed letters.  
     - A limit on wrong guesses, represented by the stages of a hangman figure.

2. **Program Flow (Simplified)**
   - **Start**:  
     - Generate a random word.  
     - Display blanks equal to the number of letters in the word.
   - **Main Loop**:  
     - Ask the user to guess a letter.
     - Check if the letter is in the word:
       - **If correct**: Replace the corresponding blank with the guessed letter.
       - **If incorrect**: Decrease lives and add to the hangman drawing.
   - **Check for Win or Loss**:
     - **Win** if all blanks are filled.  
     - **Lose** if all lives are used.

### **Step-by-Step Practical Guide**

1. **Initialize the Game**  
   - Import a library to choose a random word (e.g., Python's `random.choice`).  
   - Prepare a list of words: `words = ['mouse', 'keyboard', 'python']`.  
   - Randomly select a word: `word = random.choice(words)`.

2. **Set Up Blanks for the Word**  
   - Create a display: `blanks = ['_'] * len(word)`.  
   - Show the user the current progress: `print(" ".join(blanks))`.

3. **Track Lives and Guessed Letters**  
   - Set a variable for lives: `lives = 6`.  
   - Use a list or set to store incorrect guesses.

4. **Main Loop for User Interaction**  
   ```python
   while lives > 0 and "_" in blanks:
       guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
       if guess in word:
           for i, letter in enumerate(word):
               if letter == guess:
                   blanks[i] = guess
           print(" ".join(blanks))
       else:
           lives -= 1
           print(f"Wrong guess! You have {lives} lives left.")
   ```

5. **Endgame Condition**
   - If no blanks remain: `print("You win!")`.  
   - If lives reach zero: `print("Game over! The word was:", word)`.

### **Flowchart Reference**
Follow these key steps in your flowchart:
1. **Start** → **Generate Word** → **Display Blanks**
2. **Guess a Letter**  
   - If correct → **Replace Blank** → **Check All Blanks Filled** → **Win**  
   - If incorrect → **Reduce Lives** → **Lives Exhausted?** → **Lose**
3. **Loop Until Win/Loss**

### **Actionable Tips**
- **Test Small Pieces First**: Run basic parts like word selection and letter checking separately to avoid overwhelming errors.  
- **Use Debug Print Statements**: Add `print` to check variable values during the game.  
- **Start with Fixed Word for Simplicity**: Before adding randomness, use a single word to test logic.
